# SAS!...R(aaah), Saviours of the Data Vis

This repository contains supplementary materials for a poster presented by GEM Programming Solutions Ltd. at [PHUSE EU CONNECT 2021](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=3620&eventID=8) (number PP12). Here you will find the SAS programs and R scripts which created the plots considered as well as high resolution versions of the outputs.

### Poster Abstract
R and Python are words we hear being uttered more and more within the statistical programming community. But what are the important differences between SAS® and these open-source software packages when choosing how to visualise your data?

SAS® is the de facto software for the Pharmaceutical Industry. It provides a comprehensive validated framework with a user-friendly interface. There is, however, an increasing interest in open-source software, such as R, Python etc. Many Pharma organisations are now accelerating discussions around the use of open-source software packages. This poster will compare the use of SAS® versus open-source software focusing on the specific area of graphics capabilities.

A collection of lab boxplots and an annotated Kaplan-Meier curve will be generated using SAS® and R to compare ease of use, appearance, annotations, and animation. This poster will consider the pros and cons and explore the potential for an integrated implementation of SAS® and R.
